# node_form_example

Super simple example of a node form.

Simply adds two numbers together server side

# Notes
Do not forget to install node, npm, express, nodemon, and run npm i (which installs the packages needed by the repository) to make things work.

nodemon app.js to start the app

localhost:3000 in the browser to access the app

Cheers : )
